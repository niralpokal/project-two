# Tweeter

##About
I created a clone of Twitter using Javascript, Node JS, and a Mongo Database. I replicated the main features of Twitter so the user is able to make a profile, create tweets, follow other users, and view other users profiles. The user can also send and receive messages and is able to view notifications.

You can view a live version of it at https://fierce-savannah-72655.herokuapp.com/
